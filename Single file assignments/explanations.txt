a) The errors after removing or commenting out the 'using namespace std;' are regarding the identification of used
methods/objects that are inside the std library of cpp. The program cannot identify the prototype and definition
of the methods/objects like 'string', 'cout', 'cin' in absence of properly defining them as the method of std cpp
library as 'std::string', 'std::cout', 'std::cin'.

b) The errors after removing the 'Critter::' prefix from one of the methods in the file Critter.cpp are because
the program couldn't identify the objects and methods of that particular method inside the Critter class.

These errors can be fixed by adding 'std::' prefix for every std library functions/methods and adding 'Critter::'
prefix for every method inside of Critter class.
